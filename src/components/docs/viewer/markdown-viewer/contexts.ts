 * The renderer map used to be rebuilt whenever any of this changed — the file
 * object, the workspace's files, the folded sections. A new map means a new
 * component type for every element, and React responds to a changed type by
 * unmounting and remounting: on a 3,000-section document, opening it (the file
 * object is replaced once it is persisted) or folding one heading threw away
 * and rebuilt ~18,000 DOM nodes, over a second of main-thread work.
 *
 * The map is now a module constant (`markdown-components.ts`), and the few
 * renderers that need this read it here, so a change re-renders them alone.
