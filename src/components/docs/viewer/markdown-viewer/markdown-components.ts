/**
 * The viewer's react-markdown renderers. A module constant: its identity must
 * never change, or every element remounts (see `MarkdownRenderContextValue`).
 *
 * Folded sections aren't handled here either. They used to be, by tracking
 * the headings during render, which tied every block to the fold state; folds
 * are now applied to the rendered blocks directly (see `section-folds.ts`).
 *
 * Math: `remark-math-nodes` turns `$…$` and `$$…$$` into `<docs-math>` and
 * `<docs-eq-ref>` elements carrying the LaTeX; these entries typeset them. A
 * display equation is a block child like any other, so it folds with its
 * section. They read numbering and preferences from `MathProvider`.
