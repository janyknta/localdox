 * rendered and returning `null` under a folded one. That tied every block to
 * the fold state, so folding one heading re-rendered — in practice remounted —
 * the whole document, and it can't work once the document renders in separate
 * segments. The rendered blocks are the direct children of the container in
 * both cases, so the walk happens there instead, in one cheap pass.
 *
 * Folded blocks stay in the DOM with `hidden`, so text offsets (highlights,
 * saved passages) no longer shift when a section above them is folded.
