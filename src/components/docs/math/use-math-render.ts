/**
 * Typeset one expression.
 *
 * Two paths, and which one runs decides whether the document paints in one
 * commit or two:
 *
 *  - The fast path is synchronous and taken during render. Once KaTeX's module
 *    is resident, a KaTeX-renderable expression is already markup by the time
 *    this returns, so a document full of equations paints once with all of
 *    them present.
 *  - Everything else — the first equations of a session (KaTeX is loaded on
 *    demand, so a reader with no math never downloads it), an `align`
 *    environment needing MathJax, a Temml preference — goes through the effect
 *    and paints itself a moment later. Never the document; just that equation.
