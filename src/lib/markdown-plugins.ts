// Demand-driven remark/rehype plugin sets for the markdown viewer.
//
// `rehype-highlight` pulls in highlight.js (~279 kB). Listing it statically
// meant every reader downloaded it before the first document could paint,
// whether or not the document contained a single code fence. It is imported
// here on demand instead: each document declares what it needs, the module
// resolves once and is then cached for every document after it.
//
// Content renders immediately with whatever is already loaded; a late-arriving
// plugin re-renders the tree once. Unhighlighted code is still correctly laid
// out monospace in the meantime, so the upgrade reads as syntax colour
// arriving, not as a reflow.
//
// Math takes a different route. `rehype-katex` used to typeset it here, in the
// tree — which threw the original LaTeX away, leaving nothing for Copy LaTeX,
// Show Source, equation labelling or a fallback re-render to work from. The
// math passes below convert remark-math's nodes into elements that *carry* the
// source, and the viewer maps those to React components that typeset it
// through the MathRenderer (see `src/lib/math/`). KaTeX still loads on demand,
// now from inside that renderer.
