/**
 * Mermaid source → a bitmap a Word document can embed.
 *
 * Word is the reason this file exists. Print keeps diagrams as SVG — vector,
 * selectable, sharp at any zoom — but `.docx` cannot: Word's SVG support
 * depends on the version, falls back to a blank frame on older ones and on
 * every non-Word reader (Pages, LibreOffice, Google Docs), and Mermaid's output
 * leans on `<foreignObject>` for labels, which even Word's SVG path does not
 * render. A diagram that arrives as an empty rectangle is worse than no export.
 *
 * So the diagram is rasterised here, in the browser that already knows how to
 * draw it: serialise the rendered SVG, load it as an image, paint it to a
 * canvas at print resolution, and hand back PNG bytes. The result is a picture
 * in the document rather than a code listing — which is the whole point of the
 * feature — and it opens identically everywhere.
