/**
 * Where the explainer camera looks.
 *
 * The camera works like a teacher at a whiteboard. It moves in on the part
 * being explained, close enough that you can see what is being drawn, but
 * never so close that you lose where it sits in the whole. Once everything is
 * drawn it steps back and shows the finished picture. How it travels between
 * framings lives in camera-path.ts, and when it travels is up to the player.
 *
 * Two limits keep it honest:
 *
 *  - The zoom it may use grows with the diagram. A five-box flowchart is
 *    readable whole, so the camera only leans in a little; a sprawling
 *    architecture gets real close-ups, because that is where they pay off.
 *  - A framing never shows empty space past the diagram's edge. The picture
 *    should never look like it is sliding off the board.
 *
 * Framing is expressed as a viewBox, so a camera move costs one attribute
 * write per frame and nothing re-renders.
