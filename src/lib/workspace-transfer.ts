/**
 * Moving documents and folders from one workspace into another.
 *
 * A workspace is a closed world: file ids, folder ids, stars and highlights all
 * only mean anything relative to the record that holds them. So a "move" is not
 * a pointer change, it is a transplant — the selected records are rewritten into
 * the destination and removed from the source, and everything that referred to
 * them by id has to be carried across or it is silently lost.
 *
 * Three things make that non-trivial, and they are the reason this is a module
 * with tests rather than a callback in the sidebar:
 *
 *  - **Folders are subtrees.** Moving a folder means moving its descendants and
 *    the documents filed anywhere inside it, not just the one row that was
 *    clicked.
 *  - **Ids can collide.** Both workspaces mint ids with `crypto.randomUUID`, so
 *    a collision is vanishingly unlikely — but a document duplicated between
 *    workspaces through an import or a share link is not, and it carries its
 *    original id. Colliding ids are reassigned, and every reference to them is
 *    rewritten to match.
 *  - **Stars and highlights hang off file ids.** They live in the workspace
 *    record beside the files rather than inside them, so they have to be moved
 *    explicitly. Left behind, the reader's annotations vanish with no warning.
 *
 * The planning half is pure and exhaustively testable; `persistence` is only
 * touched by the caller that applies the result.
