# Notes panel

Select text in a Markdown document, choose **Copy selection to notes**, and the
passage is kept as clean Markdown in a panel beside the document. The source
document is never modified. Each note links back to the passage it came from.

## The problem

Readers already had a way to keep something, and it doesn't fit "I want this
passage, in my own words, next to what I'm reading":

- A **highlight** is a live mark _on_ the document. It moves when the text
  moves and is orphaned when the text is deleted. You can't edit the passage,
  only label it.

A note is the other thing: a **copy**. Once taken, it belongs to the
reader. They can edit it, search it, and copy it out. Editing or deleting the
source never reaches into it.

## Mental model

Think of a note as a photocopy with a sticky tab. The photocopy (the Markdown
`content`) never changes unless you write on it. The tab (`source`) says where
the original was, so you can go back and look. If the original page has moved,
the tab still finds it. If it was torn out, the tab says so instead of opening
the wrong page.

## Data model

`src/lib/workspace/notes.ts`, stored as `WorkspaceRecord.notes`:

```ts
interface Note {
  id: string;
  fileId: string; // source document; kept after it is deleted
  fileName: string; // name at copy time; shown only once the source is gone
  content: string; // the passage, as Markdown (≤ 200,000 chars)
  source: {
    quote: string; // rendered text of the selection (textContent): the anchor
    prefix?: string; // ~48 chars of rendered text either side,
    suffix?: string; //   to tell repeated passages apart
    start?: number; // offsets in the rendered page at copy time (hint only)
    end?: number;
    subtopicId?: string; // page (H1 section) it was on; absent in single-page mode
    headingId?: string; // nearest heading above, used when the passage is gone
    sectionTitle?: string; // shown on the source link
  };
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

Why these choices:

- **Quote anchor, not offsets.** Any edit above a passage shifts every offset
  below it. The quote (with prefix and suffix) is the same scheme highlights
  use (`text-offsets.ts`), so a note survives edits around it.
- **The live name wins.** While the document exists, the panel shows its
  _current_ name, looked up by `fileId`. A rename never leaves a note pointing
  at a stale name. `fileName` is only a fallback.
- **Notes outlive documents.** Highlights (and legacy stars) are dropped with their
  file in import validation and merge. Notes are not: they carry their own
  text.

## Flow: copying a selection

```
mouseup in the article → MarkdownViewer.openCreateMenu
   keeps offsets, prefix/suffix and a cloned Range in the menu state
"Copy selection to notes" → copyToNotes
   selectionToMarkdown(range, container)  ← clean Markdown
   nearest heading above the selection    ← headingId / sectionTitle
   onCopyToNotes({ content, source })
DocsApp.addNote → createNote → setNotes → markDirty → autosave (700 ms)
```

The Range is cloned when the menu opens because the live selection is lost as
soon as the reader clicks or types in the menu. If a re-render has replaced the
nodes it points into, the range is rebuilt from the stored offsets.

The quote is taken with `textBetween(container, start, end)`, not
`Selection.toString()`. Chrome's `toString()` is layout-aware and adds line
breaks around KaTeX's spans, so it never matches the `textContent` index that
`findAnchor` searches. A jump across an equation would then flash only the
longest matching prefix. This was found in the browser, not in the unit tests.

### Clean Markdown (`src/lib/markdown/selection-markdown.ts`)

`Selection.toString()` flattens tables into tabs, drops list markers and fences,
and spells an equation out three times (KaTeX's visual spans, its MathML, its
annotation). So the selection is converted in two steps:

1. **capture**: walk the DOM in document order between the two boundary
   points, clipping text at the ends. Viewer chrome is dropped: buttons, SVG
   icons, `aria-hidden` decoration, equation numbers, callout icons and labels,
   anything marked `data-viewer-ui`. Any equation the selection touches becomes
   its LaTeX source.
2. **render**: paragraphs, headings, lists (with `[x]` task boxes and `start`
   numbers), GFM tables (`|` escaped), fenced code with its language, block
   quotes, `> [!NOTE]` callouts, emphasis, inline code, links and `$…$` /
   `$$…$$` math.

Context rules for partial selections:

| Selection                                      | Result                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Part of one paragraph, list item or table cell | that text, no wrapper                                    |
| Any part of a code block                       | a fenced block of what was selected                      |
| Any part of an equation                        | the whole equation's LaTeX                               |
| Cells across rows                              | a table, with the header row added if it wasn't selected |

LaTeX comes from what KaTeX and Temml embed in their MathML. The app's
sanitizer (`services/math/sanitize.ts`) unwraps `<semantics>` and `<annotation>`
but keeps their text, so on the page the source is a bare text node directly
inside `<math>`, beside the `<mrow>`. `latexOf` reads that, and still accepts a
real `<annotation encoding="application/x-tex">` should the sanitizer change. An
equation still typesetting, or one that failed, shows its source as text.
**MathJax keeps no source in the DOM**, so a MathJax equation falls back to its
MathML text.

Both steps read nodes through a structural interface (`DomNodeLike`), not
browser globals, so the conversion is unit-tested in Node.

## Flow: following a source link

```
click "guide.md › Measurements" → DocsApp.openNoteSource(note)
  (a highlight card: openHighlight(h) → highlightSource(h), same path)
  openPassage(fileId, source)
  resolveNoteSource({ source }, file) pure; reads Markdown, not the DOM
    no file            → toast "no longer in this workspace"
    file in Bin        → toast "is in the Bin" (restore from Settings ▸ Storage)
    anchor holds       → handleSelect(file, page the span is on now)
                         + setPendingSaved({ span, quote, … })
                         → rangeOfAddress(span): exactly that occurrence
    quote found        → same, landing by quote (notes from before addressing,
                         or a span whose own head/tail was edited)
    quote gone         → open the heading it sat under (or its page) + toast
```

**First, the source anchor.** A note copied after source addressing existed
stores `source.anchor`: its file span plus that span's first and last 32
source characters. `relocateAnchor` keeps the span if the file still has the
same text there. If text was added or removed elsewhere, it finds the
occurrence nearest the old position. Only when the passage's own edges were
edited does it give up and fall through to the quote. This is what makes a link
to the _second_ of two identical sentences land on the second one. See
`documentation/source-addressing.md`.

**Then, the quote.** `resolveNoteSource` searches the document's Markdown with
`locateInSource` in **exact mode**. Inspect's fuzzy fallbacks (a prefix, a rare word) are fine for
placing a caret _near_ lost text, but would make a link claim a deleted passage
still exists. It tries the whole quote first, then each line of the quote that
is at least 20 characters long. A selection that crossed an equation carries
KaTeX glyphs the Markdown never contains, but its plain lines still match
exactly. Lines shorter than 20 characters ("Introduction") recur too often to
trust. The page the note came from is searched first, so a repeated passage
resolves to the reader's own copy.

Once the right page is open, the viewer re-finds the exact characters with
`findAnchor` (same quote, prefix and suffix) and flashes them. This reuses the
passage jump (`pendingSaved`, typed `PassageTarget`) that starred items used
before starring was removed. In split view, only the
focused pane takes the jump. The stored `start` offset is passed as a
tie-breaking hint only when it was measured in the same space: same page, same
reading mode.

## Highlights in the list

A highlight is also the reader keeping a passage, so the Notes list shows
highlights alongside notes. There is no Highlights list in Settings any more.
A highlight is still a highlight, a live mark rather than a copy. Only where it
is listed has changed.

- **Shown as a note, not painted.** A column of yellow and pink blocks is
  tiring to read beside a document, and the colour only has to say "this is a
  highlight". The card shows the text plainly. An 8px dot of its colour sits
  where a note shows its document icon. Screen readers hear "Highlight in
  guide.md › Install".
- **One order.** `notebookEntries(notes, highlights)` sorts both by
  `createdAt`, newest first. Highlights got an optional `createdAt` for this
  (set in `DocsApp.addHighlight`, kept by `import-schema.ts`). Older ones have
  no time. They sort below every dated entry, latest added first, because the
  array is append-ordered.
- **Same way back.** `highlightSource(h)` turns the highlight's quote anchor
  (text, prefix, suffix, page) into a `NoteSource`. `openHighlight` then goes
  through the same `openPassage` as a note's link: resolve against the
  Markdown, open the right page, flash the passage.
- **No edit button.** The text is the document's own. Recolouring and labels
  stay on the mark in the document. A label shows under the text, and search
  covers text, label, document name and page title (`searchHighlights`).
- **Delete** removes the mark from the document too. The toast offers
  **Undo**, as for notes, and ⌘/Ctrl+Z still works through highlight history.

## Persistence

`notes` is threaded through every path a workspace record takes:

| Path                      | Where                                       | Behavior                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Autosave / reload         | `DocsApp` `buildRecord`, `hydrateWorkspace` | the record is written as a whole                                                           |
| Two tabs                  | `merge.ts`                                  | merged by id; the same note edited differently in both tabs is a conflict                  |
| Backup export/import      | `serializeWorkspace`, `import-schema.ts`    | validated; malformed fields repaired, duplicate ids rejected, old backups import with `[]` |
| Move to another workspace | `workspace-transfer.ts`                     | notes follow their document, renumbered with it                                            |
| Share links               | `share.ts`                                  | **never included**: shares upload to an external host, and notes are private               |
| Storage accounting        | `recordTextBytes`                           | note content counts toward the storage cap, like documents                                 |

No backup version bump was needed. Older builds drop the unknown `notes` field,
and newer builds default it to `[]`.

Panel open/closed is a per-device convenience in `localStorage`
(`localdox:notes-open`), not workspace data.

## UI

The panel has three tabs: **Notes**, **Rough work** (scratchpads; see
rough-work.md) and **Compute** (an on-device math engine; see
math-compute.md). A note saved from rough work carries `origin` instead of a
source passage, and its link opens the scratchpad.

- **Desktop (≥1024px):** a docked column (`w-80`, `xl:w-88`) right of the
  reading column, sticky to the viewport. It stays open across documents and
  reloads.
- **Narrower:** the app's `BottomSheet`. Opening a source link closes the sheet,
  since it would cover the passage.
- Open with the notebook button in the viewer header (`aria-pressed`). Each
  note shows its source link, its rendered Markdown (folded past 288px, with
  equations and diagrams drawn; see below), when
  it was taken or edited, and Copy / Edit / Delete. Edit opens a Markdown
  textarea: ⌘/Ctrl+Enter saves, Esc cancels. Delete is immediate, with **Undo**
  in the toast. Search matches every word across content, the source's current
  name and the section.
- The panel downloads on first open (`NotesPanelLazy`, via `deferredModule` so
  a reload with the panel open doesn't pay React's 300 ms Suspense reveal
  throttle). Cards are memoized, so autosave re-renders don't re-parse every
  note.

## Equations and diagrams in notes

A note stores **source**: `$…$` / `$$…$$` LaTeX, and ` ```mermaid ` /
` ```mindmap ` fences. The panel draws them (`note-blocks.tsx`), under one
rule: it must cost the document nothing. That means no slice of the reader's
12 ms-per-task math budget, no long frames, no new bundle, and no stored HTML.

**Copying a diagram.** On the page, a diagram is an SVG of node labels plus
Mermaid's injected stylesheet, which carries a per-render id. Neither is what
the author wrote. `MermaidBlock` and the mind-map block register their element
in `lib/markdown/diagram-sources.ts`, a `WeakMap` from element to
`{ lang, source }`. A `data-` attribute would put a second copy of a
multi-megabyte source into the DOM. The registering wrapper is
`display: contents`, so layout is unchanged. `selectionToMarkdown` takes the
lookup as `diagramOf`. Like an equation, touching any part of a diagram copies
the whole fence.

**Drawing an equation** (`NoteMath`):

```
on screen?  (useOnScreen: layout-effect check, then one shared IntersectionObserver)
  no  → LaTeX source in <code>
  yes → peekRenderedMath(latex, mode, renderer)   the reader's render cache
          hit  → markup, in the same commit (no flash of source)
          miss → idleTypesetter.typeset(…)        services/math/idle-typeset.ts
                   requestIdleCallback; one KaTeX render at a time while
                   timeRemaining() > 4 ms (one per timed-out callback)
                   → renderMathIdle → shared cache → markup
```

`renderMathIdle` (renderer.ts) is `renderMathSync` without the per-task
budget. It is never charged to that budget and never refused by it, because
idle callbacks only run when the browser has nothing else to do. It fills the
same cache, so the document's own copy of an equation becomes free too. It is
KaTeX only: an expression KaTeX can't draw stays as source rather than pulling
in MathJax (~1 MB) for a side panel, unless the document already drew it, in
which case the cache has it. The cache key includes the reader's renderer
preference, which DocsApp passes as `mathRenderer`.

**Drawing a diagram** (`NoteDiagram`): only when on screen, in an idle callback,
through the reader's `renderMermaid` cache. A diagram copied from a document is
the SVG the document already made. The SVG's id is suffixed per instance,
because Mermaid scopes its styles and arrowhead markers by that id, and two
copies on one page would otherwise share or steal them. A diagram the reader
itself would hand to its GPU engine, flatten to an image, or hold back as too
heavy (`decideDiagramRender(...) !== "svg"`, or `isRenderedDiagramTooLarge`) is
shown as source. Mind maps use the reader's `MindMapBlock`, lazily, when on
screen.

**First render waits for idle.** When the panel is open across a reload, it
mounts together with the document. The note list renders in an idle callback
of its own, not in the document's first React task.

### Measured

Production build, 300-equation note copied from a 300-equation document,
docked panel. Long animation frames ≥30 ms, 3 runs each:

| Step                                  | Before           | After                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Open the panel (cache hits)           | 130 + 69 + 72 ms | none (9 equations drawn: those on screen) |
| Expand, then scroll all 300 into view | —                | none (all 300 drawn)                      |
| Reload with panel open (cold caches)  | 53–60 ms         | none, same as panel closed                |

Attribution (Long Animation Frames API): "before" was inserting 300 equations'
KaTeX markup, mostly hidden behind the fold. The same note shown as source had
no long frames. On reload, the panel's Markdown parse ran in the same React task
as the document's first render. After reload, the note's equations appear
≈665 ms in, once the document has typeset its own.

## Debugging

- **"Passage is no longer in the document" when it obviously is.** The quote
  probably crosses rendered-only text and has no plain line of 20+ characters.
  Check with `locateInSource(file.content, line, undefined, { exactOnly: true })`.
- **The right page opens but nothing flashes.** The source match succeeded and
  the DOM match didn't. Compare `note.source.quote` with the page's rendered
  text (`textBetween`). A different math renderer since copy time changes the
  glyph text.
- **An equation stays as source.** Off screen (by design); KaTeX can't parse
  it, or the renderer preference isn't KaTeX and the document hasn't drawn it
  (`renderMathIdle` returns `undefined`); or KaTeX failed to download.
  `mathRenderStats()` and `idleTypesetter.pending` show the cache and queue.
- **A diagram shows "could not be drawn".** `renderMermaid` threw. The same
  source fails in the reader too. A diagram shown as "Large diagram" was
  routed away from SVG by `decideDiagramRender`.
- **Copied Markdown contains UI text.** A component draws chrome without a
  button, `aria-hidden` or `data-viewer-ui`. Mark it, and add a case to
  `tests/notes.test.ts`.

## Known limits

- Embeds and media copy as nothing. A selection of only those falls back to
  the plain selected text. Diagrams copy as their fenced source.
- The panel draws diagrams in Mermaid's own theme. The reader's semantic node
  colouring is applied by its interactive stage after render, and isn't
  repeated here.
- Equations that need MathJax are drawn in a note only if the document has
  drawn them this session; otherwise they show as LaTeX.
- Local images (blob URLs) copy as their alt text. The URL dies with the page.
- With no documents left in the workspace, the empty-workspace screen has no
  viewer, so the Notes panel can't be opened until a document is added.

## Tests

- `tests/notes.test.ts` (29 cases): clean copy (formatting, chrome removal, lists,
  tables, code, math, callouts, element boundaries), snapshot semantics,
  search, highlights in the list (order with and without a time, search,
  following one back, `createdAt` through a backup), anchors that moved,
  repeated, crossed math, broke, or lost their document, and storage (backup round trip, validation, IndexedDB,
  two-tab merge, cross-workspace move).
- `tests/e2e/notes.spec.ts`: select a paragraph and a list on page 2 → copy →
  verify the stored Markdown → reload → search → follow the link from page 1
  back to the flashed passage. Plus the narrow-screen sheet, and a note with an
  equation and a Mermaid diagram: stored as `$…$` plus a fence, drawn from the
  cache, drawn again after a reload, with unique SVG ids.
- `tests/notes-rendering.test.ts` (8 cases): the idle typesetter (nothing
  outside idle time, deadline respected, guaranteed progress on timeout, one
  job per equation, KaTeX downloaded first), `renderMathIdle` never spending
  the reader's budget (a mutation that charges it fails the test), and diagram
  and mind-map fences in the clean copy.
